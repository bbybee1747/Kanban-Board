## Installation

To install this app, be sure to copy the code from the Repository and run the command `npm run i` to install the required dependencies, `npm run seed` to add the seeded data to log in to the application, and run the command `npm run start:dev` to start the server.

## Usage

after installing the application, navigate to the login page and sign in with one of the seeded users with their credentials. For the sake of expediency here is one user: `RadiantComet` and password: `password`. Once signed in, the page will display several example tickets on the board, which can be edited and changed to the user's liking.
